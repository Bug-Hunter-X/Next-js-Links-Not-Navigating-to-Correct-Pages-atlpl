# Next.js Links Not Navigating

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered in Next.js applications where links fail to navigate to their intended pages. The problem arises from an apparent misconfiguration in the routing setup or a mismatch between the defined links and the actual page files. 

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code causing the navigation issue.  The `bugSolution.js` file presents a corrected version demonstrating the proper way to implement Next.js links.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the Next.js development server.
4. Observe that the links on the page do not work as expected.
5. Refer to `bugSolution.js` to see the corrected implementation.

## Solution

The solution often involves verifying that:

*   The page files exist in the `pages` directory.
*   The `href` attribute of the `Link` component correctly matches the file path.
*   The `pages` directory is structured correctly according to Next.js conventions.
*   There are no conflicting router configurations in other parts of the application.
